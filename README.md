# To-Do List — Frontend Task


## Overview
A responsive, accessible, vanilla JavaScript To-Do list app that lets users add, remove, and mark tasks complete. The app meets the task requirements: uses HTML/CSS/JS, demonstrates DOM manipulation, event listeners, event delegation, and updates UI without page reloads. Tasks persist in `localStorage`.


## Files
- `index.html` — markup and app structure
- `style.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `script.js` — application logic (add, toggle, remove, clear, persistence)


## Features
- Add tasks via input or Enter key
- Toggle complete by clicking the checkbox or task text
- Remove single tasks
- Clear all completed tasks
- Clear all tasks
- Immediate UI updates without reload
- Tasks persisted to `localStorage`


## How to run
1. Place `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser or run a static server (recommended: `live-server`).
